## Home Price Prediction  

**Project Overview**  
This project involves predicting house prices based on a detailed dataset with property features. It aims to explore various machine learning models to understand the factors influencing home prices and to optimize model performance.  

**Dataset Overview**  
- **Size:** 34,857 entries with 14 columns.  
- **Features:**  
  - Property details: suburb, rooms, type, price, distance, bedroom count, bathroom count, and car capacity.  
  - Land and building characteristics: landsize, building area.  
  - Additional metadata: council area, region name, and property count.

**Key Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - **Outlier Handling:** Ensures data quality by addressing extreme or erroneous values.  
  - **Encoding:** Converts categorical variables (e.g., suburb, type) into numerical representations.  
  - Train-Test Split: Divides the data to evaluate model performance on unseen data.  

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - **Linear Regression:** Establishes a baseline predictive performance.  
  - **Lasso and Ridge Regression:** Adds regularization to prevent overfitting.  
  - **Random Forest:** A robust ensemble model to capture non-linear patterns.  
  - **Decision Tree:** Helps understand feature importance and hierarchy in predictions.  

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) are used to evaluate models.  
  - Cross-validation ensures consistency and reliability across data splits.  

**Insights**  
- **Feature Impact:**  
  - High property counts in specific regions significantly influence pricing.  
  - Factors such as room count, building area, and location are key predictors of price.  

- **Model Performance:**  
  - Regularized regression techniques (Lasso, Ridge) help in reducing overfitting.  
  - Random Forest and Decision Trees provide flexibility to model complex relationships, improving prediction accuracy.  

- **Metrics and Learnings:**  
  - RMSE indicates the magnitude of error in predicted prices, helping refine models.  
  - Outlier handling and preprocessing steps contribute significantly to model performance.  

**Takeaways**  
This project showcases how structured data analysis and careful model selection can provide valuable insights into real estate markets and improve prediction accuracy.
